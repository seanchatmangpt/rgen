#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! Canonical, deterministic, IO-free architecture kernel for ggen.
//!
//! The generic ggen Building Block calculus is the semantic authority. The
//! enterprise graph calculus layers strategy, portfolio, governance, impact,
//! migration, and evidence traceability over it. The existing Fortune 5 runtime
//! law is preserved as a profile module. This crate may manufacture bounded
//! intents, but it cannot actuate external systems.
